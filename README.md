# Data-Analysis-with-Python-Free-Code-Camp
In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, we learn the foundations of data analysis with Python, including how to extract data from sources such as CSVs and SQL, as well as how to process and visualize data using libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The projects as a part of this course is to demonstrate good foundational knowledge of data analysis with Python.

The following projects are the part of the course:

[1.Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Free-Code-Camp/tree/main/DataAnalysis/Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer)

In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

[2.Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Free-Code-Camp/tree/main/DataAnalysis/Mean-Variance-Standard%20Deviation%20Calculator)

This is to Create a function uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.


[3.Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Free-Code-Camp/tree/main/DataAnalysis/Medical%20Data%20Visualizer)

In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

[4.Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Free-Code-Camp/tree/main/DataAnalysis/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer)

For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

[5.Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Data-Analysis-with-Python-Free-Code-Camp/tree/main/DataAnalysis/Sea%20Level%20Predictor)

We will be analyzing a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 using the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
